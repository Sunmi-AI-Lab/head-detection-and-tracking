# head-detection-and-tracking

Sunmi AI Lab is the research and development unit of [Sunmi Technology Group](http://www.sunmi.com). We are working on various AI products and services for offline stores like retail stores and restaurants. The head detection and tracking is one of the AI research projects we have worked on and used the results in many applications such as customer traffic analysis etc.


To attack the detection and tracking problem, we need to collect dataset to feed into our machine learning modeling. This is the repository for experimental dataset for head detection and tracking. All the videos were filmed in our company's offices with the support of employees. We share this dataset for research purpose and no commercial usage is allowed. 

If you publish any research result based on this dataset, please cite the following reference (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08009):
